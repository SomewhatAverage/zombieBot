Everything about the weapons chest:
- What is it? The weapons chest is a chest that you can roll to get new weapons.
- Price? Each roll costs **1000** gold.
- Does it TP? After few rolls the weapons chest will be "teleported" to an other room which has a chest in it. It is normal.
- How can I know in which room the chest is?
> You can see the "Weapon chest" through walls (it's an armor stand name) and guess in which room it is.
> Right click on the chest will tell you in which room it is currently located.
> Outside you have a purple beacon which indicates the location of the chest.
- Is there a limit to the rolls? No, you can roll as many times as you want. However, every 5 rolls, the chest will "teleport".
- Which weapons can I obtain from it ?
